## Project Description 🚀
**Final capstone project after 4 months of learning about AI in Samsung Innovation Campus**<br>
This project focuses on developing an intelligent book recommendation system by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. The main goal is to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their preferences and reading history. By combining different methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Autoencoders, we explore the potential to improve recommendation accuracy and personalization. 

## Technologies Used 🛠️

* Python 🐍
* Pandas 🐼
* NumPy 🧮
* Scikit-learn 🤖
* TensorFlow 🧠
* Keras ⚡
* Streamlit 🚀

## My Role 🧑‍💻

In this project, I contributed to the following tasks:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for model consumption. 🧹
* Data Visualization: Creating charts and visualizations to gain insights from the data. 📊
* KNN Model Building: Implementing and training a KNN model for book recommendations. 🧩
* Autoencoder Model Building: Designing, training, and utilizing an Autoencoder model to extract latent features of books. 🧬
* Model Comparison: Evaluating and comparing the performance of KNN and Autoencoder models. ⚖️
