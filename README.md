## Project Description 🚀
**Final Capstone Project after 4 Months of Learning about AI in Samsung Innovation Campus 🎓**.This project focuses on developing an intelligent book recommendation system by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
* 📚 The goal is to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their preferences and reading history. By combining different methods like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Autoencoders, we explore the potential to improve recommendation accuracy and personalization. 🎯

* **In this project, we primarily focused on data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization**. 📊 As the machine learning algorithm is relatively straightforward, utilizing a simple brute-force approach to find the most similar books, we leveraged existing libraries for this part. A significant portion of our time was dedicated to refining and enhancing the input data. 🛠️

* Additionally, I employed an Autoencoder model to reduce data dimensionality, which helped optimize model performance. 🚀 You can delve into original_model.ipynb to learn about our data visualization and analysis techniques, while optimize_model.ipynb showcases the Autoencoder model that enhances the efficiency of our primary model in original_model.ipynb. 🔍

## Technologies Used 🛠️

* Python 🐍
* Pandas 🐼
* NumPy 🧮
* Scikit-learn 🤖
* TensorFlow 🧠
* Keras ⚡
* Streamlit 🚀
